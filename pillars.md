# Pillars

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Dobprotocol Pillars (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

At Dobprotocol we have 4 mains pillars being developed in synchronicity.

**Validate → Tokenize → Packaging/Distribute → Protect**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Validate: Dob Validator

1. Proves existence, operation, and revenue of machines.
2. Issues a Dob Score Stamp (TRUFA) for investor trust.
3. Transforms income into auditable, investable cashflows.
4. Revenue: Validation/Tokenization-as-a-Service.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Tokenize: Dob Token Studio

1. Converts validated cashflows into standardized tokens.
2. Acts as back office for Dob Validator.
3. Roadmap: integrate with Defindex, expand to structured products.
4. Revenue: 1.5% fee on financed assets + 0.5% on distributions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Packaging and distribution: Dob Link

1. Deploys validator-backed tokens and indexes across liquidity channels.
2. Distributes products as widgets, indexes, or connectors into wallets, operator webpages, indexers, DeFi protocols, institutional platforms, and secondary markets.
3. Deploys validator-backed tokens and indexes across liquidity channels.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Protect: Enforcement and insurance

1. Ensures recovery on defaults through enforcement partners.
2. Covers unexpected failures via insurance providers.
3. Delivers institutional grade protection for investors and asset pools.

Dobprotocol makes validated machine cashflows investable, then tokenizes, distributes, and protects them, creating a new financial layer for infrastructure yield.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
