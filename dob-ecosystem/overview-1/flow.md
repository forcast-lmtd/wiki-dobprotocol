# Dob Validator flow

### 1. **Project submission by operator**

The infrastructure operator accesses Dob Validator and starts a new submission. This includes:

* Project name and basic description.
* Technical details (type of asset, location, capacity, etc.).
* Financial projections and revenue models.
* Supporting documents (photos, invoices, energy records, permits).

Operators can:

* Save drafts.
* Edit before submission.
* Attach files securely.

Everything is tracked using their Stellar wallet for authentication.

### 2. **Internal review by Dob Team**

Once submitted, the Dobprotocol team uses the BackOffice CMS to begin the validation process. Reviewers can:

* View all submitted metadata.
* Verify documentation.
* Add internal comments.
* Mark incomplete sections for revision.

This stage ensures that all evidence is present, consistent, and up to protocol standards.

In the future, this process will be automated with AI Agents and the $DOBI token.

### 3. **Machine Score**

The project receives a **Machine Score**, a metric that reflects how trustworthy, evidence-backed, and investment-ready the infrastructure is. This score is based on:

* Quality and traceability of data.
* Clarity of revenue models.
* Physical evidence (geo-location, time-stamped media, energy use).
* Operator's history and public profile.

### 4. **On-chain publication**

If the project is approved, its validation metadata is anchored on-chain using Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar network.

This makes the project:

* Publicly visible.
* Cryptographically traceable.
* Ready for decentralized funding campaigns.

### 5. **Operator feedback and transparency**

Operators can track their validation status (e.g., “Pending Review,” “Incomplete,” “Approved”) directly in the platform. They receive feedback, update documents, and re-submit if necessary.

The entire process is transparent and auditable, helping both investors and operators build trust before any capital is deployed.
