# Dob Validator

Dob Validator is the official validation system of Dobprotocol. It serves as the entry point for real-world infrastructure projects that want to be verified, tokenized, and funded through the protocol.

Before any machine can be part of the Machine Economy, it must prove it exists, works, and generates revenue. Dob Validator makes this possible through a secure, standardized, and scalable verification process.

### Core purpose

Dob Validator solves a major problem in the DePIN space: trust.

Traditionally, infrastructure funding is slow, opaque, and based on incomplete or unverifiable information. Dob Validator replaces manual trust with verifiable proof, using a combination of structured forms, document uploads, scoring, and blockchain-based metadata anchoring.

This ensures:

* Only valid and fundable projects reach the market.
* Every machine has an auditable, cryptographic trail.
* Investors interact with real assets, not unverified claims.

### How it works?

Operators submit real data (like invoices, photos, GPS coordinates, and revenue proof) and this data is reviewed through a structured process that combines human-led due diligence with blockchain-based immutability.

Once approved, the project is published on-chain via **Soroban smart contracts (Stellar Network)** and made visible to funders via a tamper-proof verifier.

**This process guarantees:**

* Tamper-proof metadata on Stellar.
* Verifiable income and performance.
* A score that signals fundability.

### What it does?

**DOB Validator allows infrastructure operators to:**

* Submit key technical, financial, and operational data.
* Upload documentation and metadata.
* Save drafts, edit submissions, and track progress.
* Receive a Machine Score.
* Get their project certified and published on-chain (via Stellar).

**Internally, the BackOffice CMS is used by Dobprotocol's team to:**

* Review and comment on submissions.
* Score each project based on objective criteria.
* Push verified metadata directly to Stellar using Soroban smart contracts.
