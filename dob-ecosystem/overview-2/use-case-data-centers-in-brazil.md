# Use case: Data centers in Brazil

**The Opportunity:** Brazil's data center market is experiencing explosive growth driven by AI, cloud computing, and machine learning demands. Companies like Tecto are investing billions in new facilities, but traditional financing limits community participation in this infrastructure boom.

### Real-World example: Tecto's Expansion

Tecto Data Centers recently announced a $1 billion investment plan, including a new 200MW hyperscale facility in Santana de Parnaíba, São Paulo, powered entirely by renewable energy. The company operates five data centers across Brazil and Colombia, with strategic advantages including V.tal's 26,000 km of submarine cables connecting Brazil to major markets.

**Current Challenge:** Local communities and businesses near these data centers cannot directly invest in or benefit from the infrastructure development happening in their regions, despite the massive capital requirements and proven demand.

### How DobLink solves this

**Embedded investment access:** Tecto could integrate a DobLink widget directly into their website, allowing their existing clients and local communities to invest in data center capacity tokens.

**Double Yield in action:**

* **Primary Returns:** Investors earn from data center operations - server hosting fees, cloud services, and AI processing revenues
* **Automatic Reinvestment:** Monthly earnings are automatically reinvested through DeFindex on Stellar, generating additional DeFi returns

**Community impact:** Instead of relying solely on institutional funding, Tecto could tap into local capital from businesses that already use their services, creating a virtuous cycle where the community directly benefits from regional infrastructure growth.

**Practical implementation:** A small business in São Paulo could invest $1,000 in Tecto's data center tokens through their website, earn monthly returns from hosting operations, and watch those returns automatically compound through Stellar DeFi protocols - all without leaving Tecto's platform or requiring crypto expertise.

This model addresses Brazil's infrastructure financing challenges while providing communities direct access to high-growth technology assets in their own regions.
