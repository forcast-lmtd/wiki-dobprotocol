# DobLink

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/tnnuXigJguA" %}

DobLink was born at the Meridian Hackathon 2025 as a new layer in the Dobprotocol ecosystem.

**The Core Problem:** Infrastructure and machine operators lack accessible investment mechanisms for their potential investors. This barrier excludes potential investors and capital from the Machine Economy, directly contributing to Latin America's $250 billion annual infrastructure investment gap.

Additionally, earnings generated through Dobprotocol typically remain static after payout, missing opportunities to create new investment cycles and maximize capital efficiency.

**The Solution:** DobLink enables operators to embed investment opportunities directly into their websites, creating seamless pathways to invest in tokenized infrastructure. By removing accessibility barriers, it unlocks massive capital flows into the Machine Economy.

More importantly, it solves the static earnings problem through **double yield**: Machine Economy investors earn infrastructure returns that automatically reinvest into DeFindex on Stellar, making capital work twice and generating new investment opportunities without any user intervention.

Available both in individual operator widgets and Dob Token Studio, this automatic reinvestment system ensures capital generates dual revenue streams while creating continuous investment cycles: infrastructure operations plus DeFi protocol returns that generate new opportunities.

### Core Purpose

This ensures:

* Yields generated on Base automatically reinvest into DeFindex and Stellar DeFi protocols
* Decentralized infrastructure growth without user complexity
* Direct resolution of Latin America's infrastructure financing challenges

### How it Works

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Diseño sin título.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

DobLink functions as an embeddable widget with automatic reinvestment:

1. **Operators** funded through Dobprotocol generate a DobLink widget.
2. **Widget integration** - the widget embeds directly into operator websites.
3. **Instant investment** - visitors can invest in infrastructure assets immediately.
4. **Base earnings** - returns generate through Dobprotocol pools on Base.
5. **Automatic reinvestment** - monthly yields reinvest via DeFindex on Stellar, amplifying returns.

This process guarantees:

* Seamless investor onboarding without leaving operator platforms.
* Direct connection between operators, communities, and tokenized assets.
* **Double yield effect**: infrastructure earnings + DeFi reinvestment returns.
* Transparent, auditable flows across Base and Stellar networks.

### What it Does

**For Operators:**

* Embed investment flows into their branded websites.
* Provide communities direct access to infrastructure investment opportunities.
* Increase investment attractiveness through automatic yield compounding.
* Address regional infrastructure financing gaps through community capital.

**For Investors:**

* **Double yield** without manual reinvestment effort.
* Capital protection through integrated risk-coverage tools.
* Direct access to Latin American infrastructure assets.
* Borderless opportunities powered by Base and Stellar.
