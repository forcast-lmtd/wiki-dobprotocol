# Use case: Automatic protection fund

**The Problem:** When infrastructure breaks down, investors lose money with no protection.

### Real example: Solar panels break

A solar farm in Chile has 1,000 panels. During a dust storm, 200 panels break, cutting earnings by 20% for three months.

**Normal situation:** Investors lose money and get nothing back.

### How DobLink fixes this

**Simple Solution:** DobLink takes part of your earnings and builds a protection fund. If machines break, the fund pays you back automatically.

**How It Works:**

* You earn money from solar panels
* 20% of reinvestment earnings go to a protection fund
* When panels break, the fund pays you the missing money
* No paperwork, no claims - it's automatic

### Example

You invest $5,000 in solar tokens:

* **Normal month:** Earn $200 from solar + compound returns
* **Panels break:** Solar drops to $120, protection fund pays $80
* **Result:** You still get your full $200

The fund keeps growing from reinvestments, so your protection gets stronger over time without costing you anything extra.
