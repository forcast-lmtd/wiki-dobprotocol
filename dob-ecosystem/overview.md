# Dob Token Studio

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/Ltb-evJpqlo?si=fgS8y3o8ZD8nQatR" %}

Dob Token Studio is a decentralized infrastructure platform that enables people to invest in real-world machines that generate on-chain, verifiable income. Its core function is simple: make physical infrastructure investable, trustworthy, and transparent.

### How it works (Simplified flow)

* An operator requests funding for a real-world machine.
* Dobprotocol opens an investment pool on the platform.
* Future revenue is used as collateral.
* Backers contribute capital.
* The machine is deployed and begins generating income.
* Revenue flows back to investors transparently.

This structure removes the traditional friction of high-interest loans, opaque underwriting, and lack of trust in infrastructure.

#### The platform supports:

* Institutional-scale validations.
* Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS).
* Direct access to decentralized funding.
* Transparent, blockchain-based investor dashboards.
