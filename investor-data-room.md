# Investor Data Room

### Problem: The gap we fix

Billions of dollars sit in liquidity pools and capital markets, while real infrastructure projects—solar farms, EV chargers, data centers—struggle to access transparent, local funding. Communities and small investors are excluded by complexity, opacity, and high minimums requirments. Operators encounter slow, opaque financing; investors face unverifiable claims. The result: valuable machines remain underfunded and illiquid.

### Solution: What Dobprotocol delivers

Dobprotocol transforms real-world machines into verified, investable assets. We validate performance on-site (Dob Validator), tokenize future revenue (Dob Token Studio), and distribute investment opportunities through embedded channels (DobLink). Infrastructure operators get transparent funding. Investors get auditable, machine-backed yields. Everything is traceable, compliant, and built for scale.

### Overview

Dobprotocol is the credit provider for real-world machines. We bridge the gap between infrastructure that needs capital and investors seeking transparent returns. By validating machine performance, tokenizing cashflows, and enforcing on-chain accountability, we unlock billions in untapped infrastructure value across emerging markets. Where others see risk, we deliver proof.

### Who benefits

* Institutional and retail investors seeking audited, machine-backed yields.
* Infrastructure operators who need transparent, scalable funding solutions.
* Builders and service providers looking to integrate tokenized revenue models into real-world projects.

Dobprotocol makes proof into opportunity. Explore the materials in this Investor Room to see how we are turning machines into liquid capital

### Vision

We believe capital should flow to machines that produce value, not to opacity. Dobprotocol builds the rails that let operators raise capital from their communities, and lets anyone invest in real, verifiable yields.

Our vision is simple: machines that work, earn, and share. We call it the Machine Economy — and we are wiring it for the world.

### Business Model

Our business model is designed to be sustainable, scalable, and aligned with the interests of both infrastructure operators and capital providers.

Dobprotocol earns protocol-level fees through token flows, while creating new opportunities for token holders to engage in the platform's growth.

**Investor-Side Fees**

* **Investment Fee**: **1.5%** fee applied to every contribution made by investors through the platform.

**Revenue-Share Fees**

* **Distribution Fee**: **0.5%** of all revenue generated by validated infrastructure, deducted before investor distribution.

#### **Validation + Tokenization Pricing**

Operators pay a one-time fee to access the DOB Validator and tokenization process. Pricing depends on project scale and complexity:

| Tier       | Fee (USD) | Expected Infrastructure Type                         |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Small**  | $4,500    | Pilot projects, installations under $250K            |
| **Medium** | $9,000    | Infrastructure between $250K–$1M                     |
| **High**   | $18,000+  | Large-scale or high-complexity infrastructure (>$1M) |

### Our partners & ecosystem

Dobprotocol is built in the open and with the community. We work closely with Stellar, Draper U, Tellus Cooperative and regional partners across Latin America to scale adoption, compliance, and on-chain interoperability. Our stacks bridge Base (where pools are deployed) and Stellar (where DeFi reinvestment and interoperability happen), creating a cross-chain flow that multiplies capital efficiency.
