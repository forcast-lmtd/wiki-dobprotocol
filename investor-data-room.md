# Investor Data Room

Real machines produce real value. But funding them is slow, complex, and limited.

* Tokenizing assets is expensive.
* There is no liquidity for this class of Real World Assets.
* Investors don't trust what they can't verify.
* Operators struggle to raise capital without debt or giving up equity.
* There is no way to properly diversify the risks in this kind of operations.

So machines stay underfunded. And value stays trapped.

**DOB Protocol connects real machines with global investors through simple, transparent, WEB3 on-chain infrastructure - empowered by the First Liquid RWA DEX.**

> THE MACHINE ECONOMY IS LOCKED AND DOB PROTOCOL POWERS A NEW WAY TO FUND THE MACHINES' FUTURE

Operators fund their machines without giving up ownership.

Investors participate through collective investment structures, backed by real, auditable machine performance yields.

* No banks.
* No dilution.
* No traditional debt.

Dobprotocol transforms real-world machines into verified, investable assets. Everything is traceable, compliant, and built for scale. Just machines, performance, and shared value.

***

## THE SOLUTION: DOB LIQUID RWA DEX

**DOB Liquid RWA DEX** — The First Liquid RWA DEX powered by Uniswap v4 Hooks.

* Anyone can invest, trade, and exit freely.&#x20;
* Minimum investment: just $10.&#x20;
* Liquidity is built-in and transparently managed by smart contracts powered by Uniswap Hooks, and distributed through DobLink embedded channels.

**DOB Token Studio** — Verified machine revenue is packaged into investable digital assets (RWA tokens). This tokenization infrastructure feeds the DEX, creating liquid markets for real-world assets.

**DOB Validator** — Machines are verified to exist, operate, and generate real revenue. Performance and cashflow is continuously monitored and recorded on-chain, ensuring only validated assets enter the DEX.

### HOW IT WORKS

#### VERIFY

Machines are validated and performance data recorded on-chain.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### TOKENIZE

Verified revenue is packaged into RWA tokens via Token Studio.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### INVEST & TRADE

Tokens are listed on the Liquid RWA DEX for free trading.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Dobprotocol is the credit provider for real-world machines. We bridge the gap to unlock billions in untapped infrastructure value across emerging markets. Where others see risk, we deliver proof.

DOB Protocol is not just a concept, but an operational platform generating real value through tokenization of EV charging infrastructure, with a fully functional DEX marketplace.

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

Dob Protocol operates at the intersection of real-world infrastructure, verified performance data, and on-chain liquidity. As an early-stage protocol, the main risks and mitigations are:

<details>

<summary><strong>Real-World Performance Risk</strong></summary>

Physical assets may underperform, impacting yield.

Mitigation: Only machines with real-time validated performance and revenue are onboarded via the DOB Validator. Underperforming assets cannot sustain token issuance.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Data Integrity &#x26; Trust Risk</strong></summary>

Inaccurate or manipulated data could affect investor confidence.

Mitigation: Performance and revenue are continuously verified and recorded on-chain, creating auditable and tamper-resistant data flows.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Liquidity Risk</strong></summary>

RWA markets are structurally illiquid, limiting exits.

Mitigation: Liquidity is engineered, not assumed, through programmatic mechanisms and Uniswap v4 Hooks backed by revenue flows. The DEX provides built-in liquidity for all listed RWA tokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Smart Contract &#x26; Protocol Risk</strong></summary>

Smart contract vulnerabilities or integration failures may impact operations.

Mitigation: Modular architecture, staged deployments, and reliance on battle-tested DeFi primitives reduce systemic exposure.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Regulatory &#x26; Compliance Risk</strong></summary>

Regulatory treatment of tokenized revenue may evolve.

Mitigation: The protocol focuses on revenue participation, not asset ownership, with jurisdiction-aware onboarding and LATAM-first deployment.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Adoption &#x26; Execution Risk (Pre-Seed)</strong></summary>

Operator adoption and early execution risks remain.

Mitigation: Clear operator incentives (capital without debt or dilution), live proof points (eHive), and strong ecosystem partners.

</details>

**Risk Philosophy:** Dob Protocol does not remove risk — it makes risk visible, measurable, and liquid through verified performance and programmatic liquidity.

## BUSINESS MODEL

Our business model is designed to be sustainable, scalable, and aligned with the interests of both infrastructure operators and capital providers.

Dobprotocol earns protocol-level fees through token flows, while creating new opportunities for token holders to engage in the platform's growth.

### Investor-Side Fees

* Investment Fee: 1.5% fee applied to every contribution made by investors through the platform.

### Revenue-Share Fees

* Distribution Fee: 0.5% of all revenue generated by validated infrastructure, deducted before investor distribution.

### Validation + Tokenization Pricing

Operators pay a one-time fee to access the DOB Validator and tokenization process. Pricing depends on project scale and complexity:

| Tier   | Fee (USD) | Expected Infrastructure Type                         |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Small  | $4,500    | Projects up to $250K, installations                  |
| Medium | $9,000    | Infrastructure between $250K–$1M                     |
| High   | $18,000+  | Large-scale or high-complexity infrastructure (>$1M) |

## WHO IT'S FOR: Buyer Personas

### Investors (Retail & Institutional)

Access real, machine-backed returns through the Liquid RWA DEX. Transparent, verifiable, globally accessible alternative investment opportunities outside of traditional finance.

Typical flow: Invest → Yields generated → Reinvestment/composability → Returns distributed on-chain.

### Infrastructure Operators

Raise capital without equity dilution to expand and scale operations. Turn productive machines into investable assets, using verified data and tokenization to raise capital directly from investors through the DEX.

Typical flow: Onboard & validate via DOB Validator → Token Studio (creates pool) → Distribution via DobLink (embedded widget) → Listed on DEX.

Use cases:

* Mining fleets — GPUs and AI clusters
* Solar and renewable energy
* EV charging networks
* Industrial robots
* Data and IoT infrastructure

### VCs & Partners (Builders and Service Providers)

A scalable infrastructure for the future of real-world finance. Integrate tokenized revenue models into real-world projects.
