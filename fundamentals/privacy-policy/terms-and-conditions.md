### Introduction

These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the services, applications, and products offered by Dobprotocol (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By using Dobprotocol, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not access or use our services.

Dobprotocol provides a platform for tokenizing infrastructure machines, enabling fractional investment, verification, and funding through blockchain technology. Our services include Dob Validator, Dob Token Studio, and DobLink.

You represent that you are at least 18 years old. Dobprotocol is not intended for use by minors.

Your use of the service is also subject to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect and process personal data.

### Definitions

* **Account:** A unique profile created to access parts of Dobprotocol.
* **Operator:** An infrastructure owner or project submitting machines for validation and tokenization.
* **Investor:** A user who purchases tokens representing future revenue streams of validated machines.
* **Dob Validator:** The verification system ensuring machines are real, operational, and revenue-generating.
* **Dob Token Studio:** The platform enabling token issuance and investment flows.
* **DobLink:** The integration API for embedding token purchase flows into operator websites.
* **Stellar:** The blockchain network on which Dobprotocol operates, using Soroban smart contracts and Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs).

### Acknowledgment

By accessing or using Dobprotocol, you agree to:

* Comply with all applicable laws, including AML and KYC regulations.
* Provide accurate and truthful information when required (e.g., during KYC).
* Use the platform only for lawful purposes and not to engage in fraudulent or prohibited activities.

Dobprotocol may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms.

### Accounts and Identity verification

Certain features (such as investing, operating, or withdrawing) require KYC verification under SEP-0012 standards.

* You are responsible for keeping your credentials secure.
* You agree not to share or misuse access to your account.
* You may browse investment opportunities without KYC, but interaction requires successful verification.

### Use of services

* Operators may submit infrastructure projects for validation via Dob Validator.
* Investors may purchase tokens through Dob Token Studio or via embedded flows using DobLink.
* Dobprotocol does not provide financial advice. Investments are made at your own risk.
* Tokens represent future revenue rights, not ownership or equity in the operator’s machines.

### Payments and transactions

* All token purchases are processed via Stellar smart contracts.
* Payments are final and irreversible once confirmed on-chain.
* Dobprotocol does not custody user funds; wallets remain under user control.

### Licenses and Regulatory Compliance

Dobprotocol operates as a technology and validation service provider. We do not issue securities, custody client funds, or provide investment advice. Our services are limited to (i) validating the performance of income-generating machines, (ii) structuring their future revenue into onchain representations, and (iii) enabling non-custodial, automated distribution of capital flows.

Dobprotocol itself does not currently hold a broker-dealer, custody, or investment advisory license in Chile or other jurisdictions. Instead, when financial issuance or settlement requires regulatory authorization, Dobprotocol partners with duly licensed entities in each jurisdiction (such as regulated custodians, exchanges, or financial institutions) to ensure compliance with applicable law.

In Chile, Dobprotocol’s activities are structured to fall within the framework of the Fintech Law (Law 21.521) and related regulations. Tokens created through our platform represent future revenue streams, not equity, ownership, or debt instruments. Nevertheless, where local law interprets such tokens as financial instruments, issuance and settlement are carried out through licensed partners under the oversight of the Comisión para el Mercado Financiero (CMF).

All participants, operators and investors, must complete full KYC/AML onboarding before interacting with the platform. This ensures compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations in Chile and other jurisdictions where Dobprotocol operates."

### Intellectual property

Dobprotocol’s content, trademarks, and software are the exclusive property of Dobprotocol Labs. Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification is prohibited.

### Limitation of Liability

Dobprotocol provides its services “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee uninterrupted access, error-free performance, or specific investment outcomes.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Dobprotocol shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of its services.

### Governing Law and pisputes

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall first be addressed informally by contacting Dobprotocol. If unresolved, disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Delaware, United States.

### Changes to these terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through our official channels. Continued use of Dobprotocol after updates indicates acceptance of the revised Terms.
