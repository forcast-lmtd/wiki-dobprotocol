### Introduction

Dobprotocol (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our users and partners. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information across our applications and services, including Dob Validator, Dob Token Studio, and DobLink. By using Dobprotocol, you agree to this Policy.

### What we collect

* **Account & Identity information:** When required by regulation, we collect Know Your Customer (KYC) information under SEP-0012, such as name, identification documents, and residency. This data is encrypted and interoperable across Stellar ecosystem services.
* **Usage data:** Information about how users interact with our applications, including session metadata, investment flows, and operator submissions.
* **Blockchain data:** Certain information (such as machine revenue proofs, token issuance metadata, or validation timestamps) may be recorded on-chain. Blockchain entries are immutable once published.
* **No custody of private keys:** We never collect or store private keys, seed phrases, or wallet access credentials.

### Why we collect data

* **Compliance:** To meet global anti–money laundering (AML) and regulatory requirements.
* **Verification:** To validate machines, revenue, and operator claims through Dob Validator.
* **Investment enablement:** To allow seamless investor participation via Dob Token Studio or DobLink.
* **Service improvements:** To monitor usage, optimize performance, and design better user experiences.
* **Transparency:** To anchor proof of revenue and validation processes on Stellar for auditability.

### Legal bases for processing

* **Consent:** Where local law requires it, we request explicit opt-in consent (e.g., KYC submission).
* **Legitimate Interest:** To improve services, ensure platform integrity, and enable investments.
* **Compliance with Law:** To meet applicable regulations or respond to lawful requests.

### How we use & share data

* **Aggregated Insights:** Non-personal, anonymized data may be shared to illustrate trends in infrastructure funding or machine performance.
* **Third-Party services:** We rely on secure hosting, analytics, and compliance partners to process data on our behalf.
* **Blockchain publication:** Metadata and proofs published on Stellar are visible to anyone with network access.
* **Legal requirements:** Data may be disclosed if required by law or necessary to protect rights, users, or the public.

### International transfers

As Dobprotocol operates globally, data may be transferred across jurisdictions with different protections. We use safeguards such as encryption and contractual agreements to ensure data security.

### Data retention & security

* **Retention:** Personal data is retained only as long as required for compliance and service purposes. Blockchain entries remain permanent.
* **Security:** We implement technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect data. Users are responsible for protecting their wallet credentials.

### Your rights & choices

* Access, rectify, or erase your personal data where applicable.
* Withdraw consent to optional data processing at any time.
* Request data portability or object to processing under certain regulations.
* Note: Blockchain entries cannot be modified or deleted once confirmed on-chain.
* Dobprotocol services are not intended for users under 18, and we do not knowingly collect data from minors.

### Regional disclosures

We aim to comply with global privacy frameworks, including GDPR (EEA/UK), LGPD (Brazil), and CCPA/CPRA (California). Users may lodge complaints with local data authorities if needed.

### Updates to this policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be indicated by the “Last Updated” date. Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of changes.
