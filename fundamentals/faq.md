### 1. What is Dobprotocol?

Dobprotocol turns real machines like data centers or solar panels into investable assets. Operators get capital, investors get yield, and all transactions are verified on-chain for trust.

### 2. What is Dob Validator and how does it work?

Dob Validator proves a machine exists, works, and earns. We check documents, data, and location, then anchor a verified score onchain so investors can trust it before funding.

### 3. What is Dob Token Studio?

Dob Token Studio transforms validated machine revenue into investable assets (tokens). It structures the deal, publishes data on-chain, and gives investors a simple dashboard to invest and track.

### 4. What is DobLink and how does it work?

DobLink is a widget operators can add to their site so communities invest directly. Investors earn from machine revenue, and earnings are automatically reinvested in DeFi for extra yield.

### 5. How do I invest on Dobprotocol?

You can discover opportunities publicly without KYC. To invest you create an account, complete KYC when required, connect a wallet, and purchase tokens via Dob Token Studio or via an operator site using DobLink. Purchases are executed on-chain and records are auditable.

### 6. How can operators tokenize their machines?

Operators validate their machines, set investment terms in Token Studio, and publish the offering, either on Dobprotocol or through their own site with our widget.

### 7. How does KYC work on Dobprotocol?

We use Stellar’s open KYC standard: do it once, reuse across services. It’s only required when investing, operating, or withdrawing.

### 8. What is Dobprotocol’s Privacy Policy in brief?

We only collect what’s needed for compliance. Private keys are never stored. Personal data is encrypted and can be accessed, corrected, or deleted by you.

### 9. What is Dobprotocol’s relationship with Stellar?

Dobprotocol builds on Stellar and Soroban smart contracts for on-chain anchoring, token settlement, and interoperability. In 2025, Dobprotocol was selected as one of the winners of SCF Kickstart #11 and SCF Build #37, a global program by Stellar Community Fund.

### 10. How do you ensure security, trust, fees and support?

Security and trust combine cryptographic anchoring, TrustOps practices, human review, and audited smart contracts, so every funded machine has verifiable evidence. Transactions executed on-chain are final; fee structures and any platform costs are disclosed per offering.
