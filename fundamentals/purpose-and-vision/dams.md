# DAMs

A DAM is a physical machine that can operate autonomously, generate value, and interact with decentralized networks without relying on centralized intermediaries.

### What makes a Machine “Autonomous” and “Decentralized”?

To qualify as a DAM, a machine must combine:

* **Physical autonomy** (e.g., operate with minimal human intervention).
* **Digital agency** (e.g., manage data, transactions, or compute tasks).
* **Decentralized coordination** (e.g., connect to smart contracts, use verifiable data, and act within a trustless system).

These machines are no longer passive infrastructure. They become **active economic agents** in the Machine Economy.

### DAMs are the ultimate application of what we’re building

* Machines that validate themselves.
* Machines that trigger smart contracts.
* Machines that generate and distribute revenue in real time.
* Machines that can form part of **trustless networks of infrastructure.**

With DOB Validator as their entry point and TrustOps as their verification layer, DAMs become a new class of asset.

### Dive Deeper: Read the research

To understand the full potential of DAMs, we invite you to read the paper:

[**Trustworthy Decentralized Autonomous Machines: A New Paradigm in Automation Economy**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15676)

This paper, co-authored by Fernando Castillo, Óscar Castillo and Simón Espínola from Dobprotocol, outlines the core architecture and trust models required to scale this vision globally.
