# TrustOps

TrustOps is a framework for continuously building trustworthy software, designed to bring cryptographic assurance, auditability, and accountability to modern digital systems.

Instead of relying on vague security policies or assumptions of good behavior, TrustOps introduces a system where:

* Every action (deployment, edit, validation) is traceable.
* Every process is accompanied by verifiable evidence.
* Every state of the software or machine can be audited at any time.

TrustOps treats trust as a lifecycle (not a one-time certification) and ensures that trust is maintained even as the system evolves.

### TrustOps + Dobprotocol

In Dobprotocol, TrustOps powers the integrity of systems like **Dob Validator**, where human reviewers, operators, and smart contracts interact. With TrustOps:

* Submissions are cryptographically signed.
* All interactions create a verifiable audit trail.
* Metadata is anchored on-chain for transparency.
* Trust is enforced by design, not by opinion.

This makes Dobprotocol a platform that can scale infrastructure funding without compromising on trust, even in decentralized, multi-agent environments.

TrustOps was co-developed by Dobprotocol’s CTO, Fernando Castillo, in collaboration with researchers from TU Berlin and Cybernetica AS.

To understand the foundations of this framework, we recommend reading the research paper:

[TrustOps: Continuously Building Trustworthy Software](https://books.google.cl/books?hl=en\&lr=\&id=-EhEEQAAQBAJ\&oi=fnd\&pg=PA53\&dq=info:-g_dPVsNQhYJ:scholar.google.com\&ots=_LFGOM6-IU\&sig=m87XBycvHAH-eVPgPqwZErRUaRk\&redir_esc=y#v=onepage\&q\&f=false)

With TrustOps, Dobprotocol transforms trust into a process.
