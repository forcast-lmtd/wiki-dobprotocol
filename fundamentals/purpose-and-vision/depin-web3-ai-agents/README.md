# Web3

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/aa (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Dobprotocol is built on three major technological and philosophical shifts that are reshaping how we build, verify, and interact with infrastructure: **Web3,** **DePIN**, and **AI Agents**.

{% hint style="success" %}
These three pillars are the reason Dobprotocol can exist. They allow us to build a system where **machines are investable, operations are verifiable, and value flows transparently across borders and networks**.
{% endhint %}

### **Web3: Infrastructure for ownership and transparency**

Web3 provides the tools to remove middlemen, enable programmable money, and ensure data integrity. For Dobprotocol, Web3 is the **“how”**:

* Blockchain and smart contracts ensure rules are followed automatically.
* On-chain proofs make every transaction auditable.
* Wallets empower anyone to invest or operate with full sovereignty.

Web3 lets us build a permissionless platform where investors, operators, and machines interact directly.

### **DePIN: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks**

DePIN enables real-world machines to connect with blockchains. This allows physical assets to:

* Prove they exist and work.
* Share verified data.
* Receive and distribute value automatically.

At Dobprotocol, **DePIN is the “where”**: the physical world where the Machine Economy lives. Our job is to bring trust and funding into that space.

### **AI Agents: Autonomous Decision-Makers in the Machine Economy**

As machines get smarter, they will start making decisions: when to charge, when to send data, when to request maintenance. That’s where AI Agents come in.

Dobprotocol embraces **machine intelligence** not just as a feature, but as a core part of the Machine Economy. AI agents can:

* Automate operations and reporting.
* Optimize energy use and infrastructure uptime.
* Interact with smart contracts in real time.

Together, these agents reduce operational costs and increase trust, all while keeping humans in the loop.
