Dobprotocol is proud to build on the [**Stellar blockchain**](https://stellar.org/), a network designed for real-world utility, low fees, and fast settlement, making it the perfect home for the Machine Economy.

### **SCF Kickstart #11 winner**

In 2025, Dobprotocol was selected as one of the winners of [SCF Kickstart #11](https://medium.com/stellar-community/scf-kickstart-11-recap-517e73caea61), a global early-stage program by **Stellar Community Fund**. Over five intense weeks, we built and delivered the foundation of **Dob Validator**, our infrastructure validation engine.

We received mentorship, technical support, and ecosystem exposure from the **Stellar Development Foundation (SDF)** and its partners.

### SCF Build #37 winner

Dobprotocol was also selected as one of the winners of **SCF Build #37**, a major grant from the Stellar Community Fund. This recognition validates our vision of tokenizing **the future revenue of physical infrastructure**.

With this award, we are now developing the entire Dobprotocol ecosystem on **Stellar’s scalable network**. It provides us with the tools, integrations, and support to accelerate our roadmap and strengthen the trustless infrastructure we are creating for operators, investors, and communities worldwide.

### **Stellar x Draper University residency**

Following Kickstart #11, Dobprotocol [was selected](https://x.com/dobprotocol/status/1939802275859271693) to join the exclusive **Stellar x Draper University Residency 2025**. This means:

* 3 weeks of acceleration in Silicon Valley.
* Direct support from Draper University and Stellar.
* New funding opportunities and investor access.
* Strategic guidance to scale the protocol globally.

### **What we're building on Stellar**

The Dobprotocol team is actively building and deploying:

* **DOB Validator** with on-chain proof of validation (via Soroban).
* **Machine Score** modules stored immutably.
* Token distribution mechanisms using Stellar assets.
* Direct wallet-based user interactions (no centralized auth).
