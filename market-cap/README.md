# Market Cap

Dobprotocol operates in infrastructure finance — a massive market that's historically inaccessible to most capital providers. We use the TAM / SAM / SOM framework to show realistic growth potential, not wishful projections.

**Our approach:**

* We size markets based on **annual CAPEX** (capital expenditures for building/upgrading infrastructure)
* We focus on **short-cycle projects** (12–36 months) with verifiable performance
* We target **niche/medium infrastructure** where validation creates real differentiation

This keeps our projections grounded in what we can actually intermediate and earn fees from.

### Year 1: Proving the Model

#### The Opportunity

* **TAM:** $1.3T — Global annual CAPEX in physical infrastructure
* **SAM:** $18B — Short-cycle infrastructure spend in Chile and Perú
* **SOM:** $15M — Target routed CAPEX (\~$300K in fees at 1.5%)

#### What This Means

Year 1 is about **validation, not scale**. We focus on Chile and Perú — markets with strong renewable energy, mining, and data center activity. Our target is to route $15M in infrastructure financing while proving that machine validation creates fundable opportunities.

**Fee model:** 1.5% blended rate on routed capital = \~$300K in year 1 revenue.

### Year 2-3: Scaling Across LATAM

#### The Expansion

* **TAM:** $1.6T — Growing global infrastructure demand
* **SAM:** $28B — Expanded coverage to Chile, Perú, and Brasil
* **SOM:** $150M — Target routed CAPEX (\~$3M in fees)

By year 3, we expand into Brasil — the largest infrastructure market in LATAM — and scale our operator network. The target is $150M in routed capital, generating \~$3M in fees.

This represents **10x growth from year 1**, driven by:

* Proven validation methodology
* Established institutional investor relationships
* Geographic expansion with demonstrated product-market fit

### Long-Term Potential

**For context on scalability:**

If Dobprotocol eventually intermediated just 1% of the addressable TAM (\~$13B/year routed), that would generate **$130–200M/year in fees**.

At 2% penetration: **$270–400M/year in fees**.

These are long-run possibilities. Our near-term plan deliberately focuses on the short-cycle, niche infrastructure segment where we can establish defensible validation as a competitive moat.
