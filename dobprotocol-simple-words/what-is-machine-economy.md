# What is the Machine Economy?

The Machine Economy refers to a new economic model where machines (not just humans) generate, manage, and exchange value.

In this model, connected physical infrastructure like EV chargers, sensors, solar panels, or even drones can operate autonomously and generate income by offering services to the world.&#x20;

These machines are equipped with smart contracts, IoT devices, and payment rails, allowing them to interact with the digital economy directly.

### A new era

Most of the world’s infrastructure is invisible to investors. It's hard to access, harder to verify, and usually gated behind large institutions. The Machine Economy flips that script:

* Machines become investable assets.
* Blockchain makes their operations transparent and auditable.
* Investors receive real income from real-world performance.

Machines provide services, generate data, and create revenue. That value is tokenized and shared with those who help power the system.

### Decentralized Autonomous Machines (DAMs): the self-executing future

A DAM could be anything from a self-driving taxi, to a drone that delivers packages, or a factory robot that orders its own parts.

Decentralized Autonomous Machines are like a sneak peek at tomorrow: a world where machines don’t just follow orders but join us as partners in building a better economy.

They could cut waste, open doors, and make life easier, but only if we guide them right. [Read more!](../fundamentals/purpose-and-vision/dams.md)
