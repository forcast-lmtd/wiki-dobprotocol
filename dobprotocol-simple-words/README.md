# Dobprotocol in simple words

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Dobprotocol supports (Post de Twitter) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Dobprotocol is a decentralized infrastructure platform that helps people invest in real-world machines (like EV chargers, solar panels, or data centers) and earn income from their operations.

Imagine if you could support a machine that runs 24/7 and generates real money, and in return, receive a share of that income. Dobprotocol makes that possible.

**At its core, Dobprotocol connects two worlds:**

* Infrastructure operators who own machines and need funding.
* Investors who want transparent, real-yield opportunities backed by real assets.

This is not about speculation. Is about investing in things that exist, work, and earn.
{% endhint %}

To make this work, Dobprotocol uses blockchain to ensure every project is verified, every flow is traceable, and every machine is accountable.

We call this the beginning of the Machine Economy, and Dobprotocol is building the trust layer that makes it all real.
