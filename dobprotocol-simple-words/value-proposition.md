### How we transform physical infrastructure into verifiable financial products

Dobprotocol operates as a financial intermediary specializing in the origination, validation, and structuring of physical infrastructure assets. Our methodology connects three key market players through a standardized process that reduces information asymmetries and facilitates the flow of capital to real projects.

<summary>Infrastructure Operators</summary>

* **Profile:** Physical infrastructure operators that generate recurring revenues but face restrictions on access to credit due to a lack of traditional collateral or insufficient credit history.
* **Need:** Competitive financing for expansion of installed capacity, acquisition of new equipment, or refinancing of existing debt, without relying on traditional banking structures.

**Dobprotocol value proposition:**

* **Replacement of credit scoring with technical validation:** Instead of relying on subjective ratings, we assess payment capacity by verifying actual operating income.
* **Expedited process:** From application to disbursement in shorter timeframes compared to commercial banking.
* **Income-linked payment structure:** Payments aligned with the operator's cash flow cycles, reducing the risk of default.
* **Transparency as an asset:** Income traceability strengthens the operator's reputation and facilitates future refinancing.

**Access process:**

1. **Pre-validation (free):** Preliminary assessment of project eligibility.
2. **Technical and financial validation:** Certification of installed capacity, revenue streams, and operating conditions.
3. **Pool structuring:** Issuance of debt instrument backed by future asset revenues.
4. **Disbursement and monitoring:** Funds released against operating milestones; ongoing reporting to investors.
